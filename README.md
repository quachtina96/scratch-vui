# scratch-vui
Scratch VUI (Voice User Interface) is an accessible, audio user interface for Scratch. The conversational interface enables and facilitates a screen-less experience so children with low vision or blindness may engage with the core ideas behind Scratch--ideas surrounding creative learning and computational thinking. Through the interface, users may create, edit, and play projects through conversation with an agent, Scratch.

## What might this sound like?
Here's an example of a linear process of creating a project:

**You**: Scratch, new project.

**Scratch**: What do you want to call it?

**You**: Call the project “Tell me a knock knock joke.”

**Scratch**: Okay. When you say “Scratch, tell me a knock knock joke”, I’ll play the project. What’s the first step?

**You**: You say, “knock, knock.”

**Scratch**: Okay, what’s the next step?

**You**: When I say “who’s there?”, you say “King tut”.

**Scratch**: Okay, what’s the next step?

**You**: When I say, “King Tut who?”, you say “King Tut-key fried chicken!”.

**Scratch**: Okay, what’s the next step?

**You**: That’s it.

**Scratch**: Cool, now you can say, “Scratch, tell a knock knock joke”  to play the project.

**You**: Scratch, tell me a knock knock joke!
