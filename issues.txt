Here, I'm documenting various issues I encounter as I test my system...

When inside project --> "im done" fails.
When inside project --> "i'm done" succeeds, but there is no feedback as to having
exited the project.
When inside project --> Cannot play another project while editing a project... (Should I be allowed to/able to?)

? What happens when you load multiple projects into the vm? (I think the latest project overwrites it)

It's possible to get into a bad state if you create a project and add an instruction that is invalid.
TODO: never allow a project to make a change that makes an instruction invalid.
If I dont do the above, I need to handle what happens when an instruction is invalid. Right now, that just means that changes to add that results from the process_single_instruction is not what we expect.


When inside project --> when the user doesn't say "scratch" we assume that the thing to parse is a scratch command. That assumption is sort of a false one. What if the person is talking to their neighbor and then discussing something?
--> ideas
	- require the user to always say scratch when talking to VUI.
	- have multiple states when you're inside the project.

When inside project --> "scratch play currrent project" --> tries to match it to a scratch command instead of transitioning out

more complex commands are not being parsed as desired?

NLP STUFF:
- that's it (if there is only one level of nesting (allow user to forget that's it?))
- variable CALLED, list CALLED is importnat.

FEATURE:
- when the user says/asks "Scratch", be like "yeah?"

- "I don't know how to do that" is diff from "I don't understand"

- NEED confirmation of InsideProject --> Home state.

PROBLEM:
-> from home state could not see inside even though the home state says that the current project is "how you doin"....
-> from home state, similar issues with playing the current project...
--> scratch.handleUtterance("scratch see inside project 3") DOESNT actually index into project 3, but rather just goes inside the CURRENT PROJECT.

NOTE: you cannot go straight from inside a project to inside another project (by design)
