At any point, you can ask the following questions.
```
Scratch, how many projects do I have?
Scratch, what projects do I have?
Scratch, project am I on?
```

The following questions make more sense when you are inside a project.
```
Scratch, what step am I on?
Scratch, how many steps are there?
```

To go back to a previous state, say
```That’s it``` OR ```I’m done```

In the future, we'd like to support
```
Scratch, help!
Scratch, where am I?
```
