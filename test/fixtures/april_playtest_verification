// To test whether you can play a project inside of a project
new project
debug one
say hello
i'm done

debug one
// scratch should say hello

new project
try to use a project
play the chomp sound
debug one
// scratch should say Okay, what's the next step.
play the meow sound
i'm done

try to use a project
// scratch should play the chomp sound, say hello, and then play the meow sound

realistically, what will it take to make this happen?

ATTEMPT 1:
-> on this scratch vui side--> generating the list of sentences that will create the program....
--> what about when the command sits INSIDE of the a loops

failure mode: "debug one forever."

ATTEMPT 2:
"debug one forever."

scratchNLP - needs to know what things are valid project names. Add a new kind of message to be understood.
everytime someone creates a new project, notify scratchNLP of that project name.

PRIORITY:
prevent the bug where the command/argument gets repeated!
